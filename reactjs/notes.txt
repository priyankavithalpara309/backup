React is JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

ReactJS is an open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces. ReactJS is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. It is widely used as a base in building single-page websites and mobile applications. It is very easy to use, and it allows users to create reusable UI components.


JSX:

props:
============================

Every component can have attributes similar to HTML attributes and each attribute’s value can be accessed inside the component using properties (props).

Props are properties to be used inside a component. They act as global object or variables which can be used inside the Component.


state:
====================================

React components has a built-in state object.

The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component.
When the state object changes, the component re-renders.

State represents the value of a dynamic properties of a React component at a given instance. React provides a dynamic data store for each component.

==> Controlled Component & Uncontrolled component:

-> An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled input or Controlled Component”.

-> The alternative is uncontrolled inputs or components, where form data is handled by the DOM itself.
